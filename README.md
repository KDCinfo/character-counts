# Character Counts

## a Chrome extension

Character Counts is a Chrome extension available on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/character-counts/oejjbdomlkocggekafhncjfgligaadfd).

* It allows you to see how many characters are in a pre-selected range.
* The extension will also convert characters between ASCII (char), ASCII (int), &amp;&amp; 8-bit (Byte).

## character conversion

The 'character conversion' section of code is available separately:

## background

Character Counts was the result of my final project for Harvard's CS50 course.
My 'Final Project' Presentation can (embarssingly enough) be [found on YouTube](https://youtu.be/xvhd1N7xL5k) at: [https://youtu.be/xvhd1N7xL5k](https://youtu.be/xvhd1N7xL5k)

## history

2017-10-15
* Added error logic (primarily for when running extension on a Chrome page).
* Added link to GitHub repository.
* Spruced up readme.

2017-10-17
* Added link to Chrome Store.

2018-02-05
* Updated link colors.
* Added conversion 'source' option. You can now choose if your source string is ASCII(char), ASCII(int), or Binary. The 'Convert' link will then cycle through the 3 conversions (although really 2; one output will always be the same as one source input).
  - Fixed spacing issue with ASCII(int) and Binary source conversions.
