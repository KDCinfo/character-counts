# Character Counts

## a Chrome extension

Character Counts is a Chrome extension available on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/character-counts/oejjbdomlkocggekafhncjfgligaadfd).

* It allows you to see how many characters are in a pre-selected range.
* The extension will also convert characters between ASCII (char), ASCII (int), &amp;&amp; 8-bit (Byte).
