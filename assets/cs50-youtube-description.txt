Hello there, and welcome to my final project for Harvard's CS50 course.

["CHARACTER COUNTS"]

The Character Counts Chrome browser extension was published on October 1, 2017, and can be found in the Chrome Web Store.

The extension comes complete with a screenshot, and its very own custom icon(s) which I created as part of the extension design.

I wrote the text conversion part of this extension separately so it can also be used in other environments (such as inside HTML e-mails for fun).

Inquiring Minds (the backstory): I'm always wanting to know the character counts of things for one reason or another, and find myself having to open OpenOffice Writer quite often (a lovely app, but a tad overkill to get a simple character count).

[WHY I TOOK CS50]

In my research to become a better developer, I found Harvard's CS50 course referenced in the following article by Zach Shallbetter:
    https://github.com/frontenddevelopers/Frontend-The-Beaten-Path

Sounds good, but why take the course?

I subsequently found the following question: [How Hard is CS50x](https://www.quora.com/How-hard-is-CS50x)
    Quora answer by John Birchall on Mar 3, 2016
    "For someone who is a beginner or near beginner in computer science, or C programming, or web programming, or algorithms, all the good things they say about the course are true."

In my 28-year career being self-taught with computers, I felt I could benefit from some solid CS fundamentals as I continue my current venture into full-stack JavaScript engineering.

Hello there and welcome to my final project for Harvard's CS50 course.

In the beginning...
    I had NO idea...
        of just WHAT...
            I would create for a final CS50 project.

[SLIDE - FADE IN - PORTFOLIO PAGE]

Hello again. My name is Keith Commiskey.
The following video collage is a little background and walkthrough of my final project for Harvard's CS50 course.

[SLIDE - CS50 - https://www.youtube.com/user/cs50tv]
-----------------------
I watched through all the end-of-course seminar videos, and I wondered if I could...

[SLIDE - YOUTUBE - SEMINAR - AUTOMATED ANALYSIS OF MUSIC AND AUDIO (VIVEK JAYARAM) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sftoik64tay&t=15]
-----------------------
...become a DJ?
Maybe not... I can't really tell a tuning fork from a carving fork
(I could however direct you to the nearest Git Fork).
But... then...

[SLIDE - YOUTUBE - SEMINAR - CHROME EXTENSIONS (WALTER MARTIN) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz7hrdj9e-o&t=17]
-----------------------
... ...Creating a browser extension would be fun; and getting one in the Chrome Store could be kind of cool.

[SLIDE - GITHUB 'CHARACTER COUNTS' - https://github.com/kdcinfo/character-counts]
-----------------------
And so with that, I set out to build my first browser extension.
The result? I built 'Character Counts': A Chrome Web Extension written with a little JavaScript.

[MP4 SCREEN CAPTURE FROM ActivePresenter]
-----------------------
The extension will count selected characters on the page -- and can convert them between ASCII (char), ASCII (int), and a binary 8-bit representation of a byte.
The text conversion part I wrote first as its own component, so it can be used in other environments. And that code is also available separately.

That's about it.
