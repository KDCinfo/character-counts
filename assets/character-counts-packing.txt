[PROJECT/PRESENTATION CREATION]

Extension Creation:
    Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
        Runs inside a VirtualBox VM
    Windows 10
        Sublime Text 3

Presentation:
    OpenOffice Impress
        At first I didn't think this would work, as I couldn't figure out how to do slide transitions (gotta open the right panel... doh!!)
        I was impressed with the straightforwardness of Impress. It worked really well for such a 'relatively' simple project such as this.
        ('relatively'-speaking, of course, being this presentation took longer than all of my projects.)
    Audacity
        I'd used Audacity 10+ years back, and it was as fun to use today as it was back then.
        If sound is required in your project at all, Audacity is a project-saver!!!
    ActivePresenter
        Captured the Character Counts walkthrough; saved as MP4 (ported to OpenOffice Impress).
        I did not redo all the slides I'd done with OpenOffice Impress. Instead, I simply recorded the OpenOffice Impress playback.
        I had one issue with the MP4 that was generated: As ActivePresenter recorded the OpenOffice Impress presentation playback, ActivePresenter would not record the MP4 section of the OpenOffice Impress playback. It just showed a magento/purplish screen.
        I improved this by splitting the ActivePresentation recording, and importing the MP4 directly with that section of the audio (which came over to the new track after I split the main track).
        I then added the few screens and their transitions at the end.
    Adobe Photoshop Elements 12
    Windows Recorder
        (didn't end up using)
        Found out later it only records up to 30 second clips.
    Win-G [Windows 10 Screen Recorder]
        (didn't end up using)
        Would only capture the browser window, and not the Chrome extension pop-up.
        I tried starting Win-G with the pop-up open and active, and it still wouldn't record it.
    Shotcut
        (didn't end up using)
        Got everything working except, Win-G didn't work as hoped, so needed a screen capture, and
        being ActivePresenter already had one built in, just did what little editing I had left in there
        (there wasn't much editing to do after I'd done most of the presentation with OpenOffice Impress.)

[CHROME STORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION]

This extension is fairly simple, straight-forward, and self-explanatory (if not, please let me know what I can do to enhance it).

Its code is also sourced on GitHub (feel free to make a PR for adding something useful).

I always 'kind of' knew what a byte was, but as with so many other concepts, Harvard's CS50 solidified all this knowledge for me throughout the entire course.
Thanks to David for some awesome presentations, and to Doug and Zamyla for their countless hours of video presentations as well.
"Character Counts" was my first browser extension and was inspired by Walter Martin's seminar on Chrome extensions (part of Harvard's CS50 Final Project).
P.S. The archeology presentation was fascinating and superb! I need to go back and finish playing "Riddle of the Sphinx" :) (and its sequel!)

    Hello again. My name is Keith Commiskey.
    The following video collage is a little background and walkthrough of my final project for Harvard's CS50 course.

[slide - CS50 - https://www.youtube.com/user/cs50tv]
    I watched through all the end-of-course seminar videos, and wondered if I could...

[slide - YouTube - Seminar - Automated Analysis of Music and Audio (Vivek Jayaram) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFtoiK64TaY&t=15]
    ...become a DJ?
    Maybe not... I can't really tell a tuning fork from a carving fork
    (I could however direct you to the nearest Git Fork).

    But then...

[slide - YouTube - Seminar - Chrome Extensions (Walter Martin) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz7HRDj9E-o&t=17]
    ... ...Creating a browser extension would be fun; and getting one in the Chrome Store could be kind of cool.

[slide - GitHub 'Character Counts' - https://github.com/KDCinfo/character-counts]
    And so with that, I set out to build my first browser extension. The result? I built 'Character Counts': A Chrome Web Extension written with a little JavaScript.

----------
Cross over to live-capture on Chrome (single-tab page) (capture with Win-G)
----------

The extension counts any selected characters on the page, and can convert them between ASCII (char), ASCII (int), and a binary 8-bit representation of a byte.
It comes complete with a screenshot, and its very own custom icon which I also created.

The extension was published on October 1, 2017, and can be found in the Chrome Web Store at: (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/character-counts/oejjbdomlkocggekafhncjfgligaadfd).
It can also be found via the store's search: (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/character%20counts?hl=en-US&_category=ext/11-web-development)

The text conversion part I did for fun, in that I wrote that component separate so it can be used in other environments (such as inside HTML e-mails, or on my resume :) ).
I always 'kind of' knew what a byte was, but as with so many other concepts, Harvard's CS50 solidified all this knowledge for me throughout the entire course.

The conversion section of the code is available separately as
    a <a href="https://gist.github.com/KDCinfo/be7b9dbd42c6cc3c0e4ae79bfae9ffb9">Gist on GitHub</a> and as
    a <a href="https://codepen.io/KeithDC/pen/aLyOjy">Pen on CodePen</a>.</div>

P.S. The archeology presentation was fascinating and superb! I need to go back and finish playing "Riddle of the Sphinx" :) (and its sequel!)

Inquiring Minds (the backstory): I'm always wanting to know the character counts of things for one reason or another, and find myself having to open OpenOffice Writer quite often (a lovely app, but a tad overkill to get a simple character count).
