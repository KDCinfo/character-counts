Created the following files:

Extension: \character-counts.crx
Key File: \character-counts.pem

Keep your key file in a safe place. You will need it to create new versions of your extension.

Chrome Store Detailed Description:

This extension is fairly simple, straight-forward, and self-explanatory (if not, please let me know what I can do to enhance it).

Its code is also sourced on GitHub (feel free to make a PR for adding something useful).
* GitHub: https://github.com/KDCinfo/character-counts

I wrote the text conversion part of this extension separately so it can also be used in other environments (such as inside HTML e-mails for fun).

The conversion section of the code is available separately as a

Inquiring Minds (the backstory): I'm always wanting to know the character counts of things for one reason or another, and find myself having to open OpenOffice Writer quite often (a lovely app, but a tad overkill to get a simple character count).

I built 'Character Counts' as a Chrome Web Extension using JavaScript.
The extension counts any selected characters on the page, and can convert them between ASCII (char), ASCII (int), and a binary 8-bit representation of a byte.
It comes complete with a screenshot, and its very own custom icon which I also created.

'Character Counts' was published on October 1, 2017, and can be found in the Chrome Web Store at: (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/character-counts/oejjbdomlkocggekafhncjfgligaadfd).
It can also be found via the store's search: (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/character%20counts?hl=en-US&_category=ext/11-web-development)

The text conversion part I did for fun, in that I wrote that component separate so it can be used in other environments (such as inside HTML e-mails, or on my resume :) ).
I always 'kind of' knew what a byte was, but as with so many other concepts, Harvard's CS50 solidified all this knowledge for me throughout the entire course.

The conversion section of the code is available separately as
